# Create Azure VM

The developer at Mystique Unicorn are looking monitor their app from the custom logs generated by the app running inside a Azure VM 
Can you show them how the can get started ?

## üéØ Solutions

This repository holds the bicep code to deploy,
- Virtual Machine(RedHat) inside a Vnet with public access.
  - Bootstrapped with custom libs using `customData` script
- Log Analytics Workspace
dddd- Data Collection Rule - To collate, transform and push the custom logs from the VM to custom() table in log analytics workspace

1. ## üß∞ Prerequisites

   This demo, instructions, scripts and bicep template is designed to be run in `westeurope`. With few or no modifications you can try it out in other regions as well(_Not covered here_).

   - üõ† Azure CLI Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
   - üõ† Bicep Installed & Configured - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install)
   - üõ† VS Code & Bicep Extenstions - [Get help here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#vs-code-and-bicep-extension)

2. ## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up the environment

   - Get the application code

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/miztiik/azure-create-vm
     cd azure-create-vm
     ```

3. ## üöÄ Prepare the environment

   Let check you have Azure Cli working with 

    ```bash
      # You should have azure cli preinstalled
      az account show
    ```

    You should see an output like this,

   ```json
    {
      "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
      "homeTenantId": "16b30820b6d3",
      "id": "1ac6fdbff37cd9e3",
      "isDefault": true,
      "managedByTenants": [],
      "name": "YOUR-SUBS-NAME",
      "state": "Enabled",
      "tenantId": "16b30820b6d3",
      "user": {
        "name": "miztiik@",
        "type": "user"
      }
    }
   ```

4. ## üöÄ Deploying the application

   Let us walk through each of the stacks,

   - **Stack: Main Bicep**
     The helper deployment script `deploy.sh` will deploy the `main.bicep` file. This will inturn call the modules for RG,VNet & VM creation

     ```bash
     sh deploy.sh
     ```

     After successfully deploying the stack, Check the `Outputs` section of the stack for the resources.


5. ## üî¨ Testing the solution

   1. **Connect to the VM**

    ```bash
    ssh miztiik@publicIP
    ```

    You should be able to connect to this server on port `22` from the internet. This is should not be the case in production. You would want to secure that with restricted to private IP space or use a bastion or just-in-time access.

  1. **Troubleshooting Azure Monitor Agent**

    - In case if you are facing issues, log into the VM and check the logs `/var/log/azure/Microsoft.Azure.Monitor.AzureMonitorLinuxAgent/` for potential causes.
    - From the portal, you can query to find if the agent is reporting to Azure Monitor

    ```sh
    Heartbeat | where Category == "Azure Monitor Agent" and Computer == "<computer-name>" | take 10
    ```

    Check if the AMA is running,

    ```sh
    systemctl status azuremonitoragent
    ```

      
6. ## üìí Conclusion

Here we have demonstrated how to bicep to create Resource groups, Vnets and VMs

2. ## üßπ CleanUp

If you want to destroy all the resources created by the stack, Execute the below command to delete the stack, or _you can delete the stack from console as well_

- Resources created during [Deploying The Application](#-deploying-the-application)
- _Any other custom resources, you have created for this demo_

```bash
# Delete from resource group
az group delete --name Miztiik_Enterprises_001 --yes
# Follow any on-screen prompts
```

This is not an exhaustive list, please carry out other necessary steps as maybe applicable to your needs.

## üìå Who is using this

This repository aims to show how to Bicep to new developers, Solution Architects & Ops Engineers in Azure.
